# can Laddrick not swim well enough?
##It would be cool if Monsters could appear randomly (like in Across the Harsh Sands) and didn't have names and appeared out of the depths to attack and stayed put a little more
## should I keep fog or not? then its obvious where the beasties are and the Naga SHOULD swim up but them you can't Grissa
#Make the metal comment work better

      story= _ "Having gained the respect of Eloria and the help of her mermaids, Tyco next embarks on his quest to get more metal for better weapons to fight the battles to come. West, towards the human land of the Green Isle there is a small island. Humans inhabit it, rarely interacting with other humans. They survive by fishing the bays and trading for other necessities from the sea peoples. Lord Typhon had very little to do with them, but Tyco's choices are few and his needs many."
